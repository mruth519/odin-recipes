        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
        <li>Steamed rice</li>
        <li>5 scallions, thinly sliced (green and white parts)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped parsley</li>
        <li>Hot sauce, as desired</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If using whole crawfish, peel by removing the head and, with the back of your thumbnail, push the fat inside the head into a small bowl. Peel the crawfish around the meat
            so that the top of the tail still has some fat attached to it. You need about 1/3 cup of fat and 2 pounds crawfish meat.</li>
        <li>Make the stock. Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium high heat. Add the shells and crunch them down with a wooden spoon. Add the water, vegetables scraps, and bay leaves
            and simmer until reduced by about half, about 1 hour. Strain the stock and discard the solids. Measure 4 cups stock for the etoufee and freeze the remaining for future use.</li>
        <li>Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter and the head fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Add the onion, celery, poblano, bell pepper, jalepeno, garlic, and seasonings and cook, stirring until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the crawfish meat and the remaining 4 tablespoons butter
            and cook until the butter has melted.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the mixture with the flour and stir until all ingredients are coated.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crawfish stalk and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until slightly thickened and they begin to break down and release their sweetness.</li>
        <li>Stir in the lemon juice and taste for seasonings, adding more salt as desired.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice, garnished with scallions, parsley, and hot sauce, as desired.</li>
    </ol>
